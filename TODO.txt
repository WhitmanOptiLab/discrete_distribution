TODO List:

Make two versions of WRS applications which:
	1. Create 10k elements with random weights between 0-10
	2. Create WRS data structure
	3. Randomly choose elements 10k times

	Make two or more versions, one with our WRS and some other libraries

Make another set of similar tests where we:
	1. Create 10k elements with random weights between 0-10
	2. Create WRS data structure
	3. Randomly choose elemtes 10k times and adjust the weight by between +5 -5 randomly
		(For other libraries this may require repeating a whole new WRS data structure)

	Test same libraries
